Comprehensive Market Analysis and Customer Insights for a Global E-commerce Platform

In this project, I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst for a mid-sized e-commerce platform specialising in lifestyle and wellness products. The platform operates across multiple regions worldwide, serving a diverse customer demographic. With increasing competition from established and new online retailers, the company needed a deeper understanding of its market dynamics, customer demographics, product performance, and regional sales patterns. Leveraging a vast sales, customer, and product data dataset, I conducted a comprehensive market analysis to uncover valuable insights. The goal was to inform strategic decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and identify new opportunities for market expansion.


Key Responsibilities:
1.	Data Quality Assessment:
  - Conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to evaluate the dataset's quality.
  - Identified and addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
  - Implemented data cleaning techniques to enhance data integrity for subsequent analysis.
2.	Descriptive Statistical Analysis:
  - Performed a thorough statistical analysis to understand the current market scenario.
  - Analysed customer demographics, including age, gender, and preferences, to identify key customer segments.
  - Developed visualisations such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to communicate demographic distributions effectively.
3.	Product Performance Analysis:
  - Utilised data visualisation tools to compare the performance of different product categories.
  - Highlighted top-performing products and categories, as well as identified underperforming ones.
  - Created visualisations such as heatmaps and stacked bar charts to present product performance insights.
4.	Regional Sales Analysis:
  - Analysed regional sales data to pinpoint strong and weak markets.
  - Geo-visualisations, such as choropleth maps and geographic heatmaps, were employed to display regional sales patterns.
  - Provided insights into regional trends and identified opportunities for targeted marketing strategies.
